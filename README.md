Visionoir.com web player
========================
### WORK IN PROGRESS

Web player and visualizer made for the Visionoir rock band website.
It analyzes mp3 data from html5's audio element and translates it to VHS-like image distortion.

========================
Early alpha available @ http://visionoir.com/app/ _highly recommended to try it under Chrome, Firefox seems to be a little unstable with the AnalyserNode)_     
(At the moment audio is played automatically, and there's no way to stop it, sorry ;) It seems that it's true, that [you can't stop rock'n'roll](http://youtu.be/0E4lpOdthn8?t=2m23s)...)
